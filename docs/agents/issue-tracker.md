# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs for this repo live as GitHub issues on `vextrus/vextrus-cubit`. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

**The repository is public for now (the owner, 29 Sep 2026; ADR 0024's private setting returns when the owner says), so issues are written as if anyone could read them.** An issue
or PR never carries a secret or key, anything from `.private/` (the Edison set, the Sample Project,
client drawings: their names, figures or content), or a client's data. Refer to the owner by role.
Labels beyond triage: `cloud` (provable by committed tests) and `local` (needs real drawings or the
owner's eyes); see docs/sdlc.md.

## Conventions

gh 2.45 dies on Projects (classic) for `--comments`, gh pr edit and a `view` without `--json`; the guard
refuses an inline body over 72 characters or with a dollar sign or backtick, and a `--body-file` whose file has
no leak stamp. So a body goes in a file under `.private/work/`, scanned first, and each write is its own call.

- **Create an issue**: `uv run python -m tools.leakscan file <f>`, then, as its own call,
  `gh issue create --title "<title>" --body-file <f>`.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,comments`, filtering comments by `jq`.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: scan the file, then `gh issue comment <number> --body-file <f>`.
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number>` (comment first, as above, when it needs a reason).

Infer the repo from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside a clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --json title,body,labels,comments` and `gh pr diff <number>` for the diff.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments` then keep only `authorAssociation` of `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR`, or `NONE` (drop `OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`).
- **Comment / label / close**: `gh pr comment <number> --body-file <f>` (scanned first), labels with
  `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` (one number space; gh pr edit dies on gh 2.45), `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be either: resolve with `gh pr view 42 --json number` and fall back to `gh issue view 42 --json number`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: a single issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body. `gh issue create --label wayfinder:map`.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue (`gh api` on the sub-issues endpoint). Where sub-issues aren't enabled, add the child to a task list in the map body and put `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Labels: `wayfinder:<type>` (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`). Once claimed, the ticket is assigned to the driving dev.
- **Blocking**: GitHub's **native issue dependencies**, the canonical, UI-visible representation. Add an edge with `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<child>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`, where `<blocker-db-id>` is the blocker's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`, _not_ the `#number` or `node_id`). GitHub reports `issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by` (open blockers only, the live gate). Where dependencies aren't available, fall back to a `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` line at the top of the child body. A ticket is unblocked when every blocker is closed.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children (`gh issue list --state open`, scoped to the map's sub-issues / task list), drop any with an open blocker (`issue_dependencies_summary.blocked_by > 0`, or an open issue in the `Blocked by` line) or an assignee; first in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`, the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: scan the answer's file, then `gh issue comment <n> --body-file <f>`, then `gh issue close <n>`, then append a context pointer (gist + link) to the map's Decisions-so-far.
