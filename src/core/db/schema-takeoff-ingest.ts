// SEAM-TENANT: the takeoff-ingest area's tables, with the closed rosters their CHECKs are written from.

// The ORM's table builders are a driver import and the seam's own directory is their one lawful home,
// which is why this file is a flat sibling of `schema.ts` rather than a file in a directory beneath it
// (scripts/eslint/rules/no-db-outside-seam.mjs allowlists `src/core/db.ts` and ONE level under
// `src/core/db/`, and nothing deeper). `db/schema/*.ts` is the tree drizzle-kit reads these back out of.
//
// Nothing here reaches the seam, the pools or the jobs store: those are built over the schema, so the
// dependency runs one way and no cycle is representable (ARCH-01, ARCH-02).
