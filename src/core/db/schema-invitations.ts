// SEAM-TENANT: the invitations area's tables, with the closed rosters their CHECKs are written from.
//
// The ORM's table builders are a driver import and the seam's own directory is their one lawful home,
// which is why this file is a flat sibling of `schema.ts` rather than a file in a directory beneath it
// (scripts/eslint/rules/no-db-outside-seam.mjs allowlists `src/core/db.ts` and ONE level under
// `src/core/db/`, and nothing deeper). `db/schema/*.ts` is the tree drizzle-kit reads these back out of.
//
// Nothing here reaches the seam, the pools or the jobs store: those are built over the schema, so the
// dependency runs one way and no cycle is representable (ARCH-01, ARCH-02).

/**
 * R-SPINE-003's invitation: an offer of membership made to an address before there is a membership
 * to hold it. The row is the offer, never the answer — accepting it writes `memberships`, and this
 * table only records that the offer was made, at what role, by whom, and how it ended.
 *
 * The address is held as the fold `users.email` holds one (`server/auth/folded-key.ts`), so an
 * invitation and the account that eventually spends it are matched on the same key, and a value too
 * long for a btree index cannot fault a door that never judged it.
 *
 * The token is a bearer secret, so only its digest is stored — the same discipline `auth_tokens`
 * keeps. `consumed_at` and `revoked_at` are the two ways an offer stops being spendable; both are
 * recorded rather than deleted, so an invitation that was withdrawn is distinguishable from one that
 * was never made when an operator asks.
